        <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
         <ul>
            <li>1 cup raw unsalted cashews (see note if you don't have a high-powered blender)</li>
            <li>3 cups non-dairy milk (a thicker variety such as Califia brand)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons pure maple syrup (sub agave or cane sugar)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Recommended Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High-Powered Blender (see note)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all the ingredients to a high-powered blender then blend on high for 1-2 minutes until creamy and 
            smooth. Taste for flavor and add more nutmeg, cinnamon, maple syrup, or vanilla if needed.</li>
        <li>Place in the fridge for 2-3 hours to chill and thicken OR serve warm by gently heating on the stove over 
            medium-low heat until warmed throughout. See note for serving suggestions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blender:</strong></li> If you don't have a high-powered blender (like a Vitamix), you will need to soften 
        the cashews first. To soften, boil water in a small pot and remove from heat. Add cashews and cover for 20 minutes. Now drain, 
        rinse, and discard soaking water. Alternatively, you can soak the cashews in water for 4-6 hours or overnight in the fridge. 
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong></li> This vegan eggnog is thick and creamy but it's not as thick as traditional eggnog. I prefer 
        it this way, but if you would like a thicker consistency, replace 1.5 cups of the listed non-dairy milk with 1.5 cups of full-fat 
        canned coconut milk (so it'll be 1.5 cups of non-dairy milk, 1.5 cups of coconut milk and the 1 cup of cashews). I don't feel that the 
        coconut taste overpowered it at all. It's rich, thick, and super creamy. 
        <li><strong>Add-In Ideas:</strong> A pinch or two of ground ginger, cloves, allspices, or cardamom. You can also use a dash of 
            almond extract or peppermint extract for an extra pop of flavor. </li>
        <li>Serve with vegan whipped cream and a cinnamon stick or star anise for garnish.</li>
    </ul>

    </ol>
